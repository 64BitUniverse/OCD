# OCD
The place to get the (unoffical) OCD resource pack by disco! If you are missing some of that classic smoothness, then look no further! We have 1.12-1.15.2 right here! 

Note: We don't have specific versions like 1.14.1, for example, but any texture pack that is for the same version, ie 1.14.x, should work fine. 

To make it clear, I am not the original creator. The originial was a guy by the name of FVDisco. The man is a legend in the Minecraft community. Even though he hasn't released a new video after 6 years, you should still go check out his redstone videos. They were mental.

KNOWN MISSING TEXTURES:
 - Most mobs
 - Smoker
 - Shields
 - Shukers
 - Bee stuff
 - Loom
 - Magma Rock
 - Armor
 - Almost all items
 - Berreis
 - End Crystal
 - Nether Wart
 - Wither Rose
 -Sea Grasses
 
 
BLOCKS MISSING CAUSE OF NAMES (I think)
  - Minecarts look a bit weird. Not much, just the lines on the sides
  - Coco Beans
  
 
NOT PLANING TO MAKE
  - Glazed Terracota
  - All Coral
  - Concrete
  - Concrete Powder
  - Particles
  
Why?
Because I think they are really complicated textures and they are hard to get in line with my vision of the texture pack, or in the case of concrete (and the powder), I don't think they really need to be changed. If anyone has suggestions or ideas, make a fork and commit the items to the fork, and make an Issue post. The title should be (BLOCK IDEA) *Block Name*
  
  
That's all I know about. There are some that I fixed, but haven't commited yet. They aren't on the list. I was going to do the renaming in one go and then commit everything. If you find other things, make a Issue post with (MISSING TEXTURE) *Block Name*
