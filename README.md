# OCD
The place to get the (unoffical) OCD resource pack by disco! If you are missing some of that classic smoothness, then look no further! We have 1.12-1.15.2 right here! 

Note: We don't have specific versions like 1.14.1, for example, but any texture pack that is for the same version, ie 1.14.x, should work fine. 

To make it clear, I am not the original creator. The originial was a guy by the name of FVDisco. The man is a legend in the Minecraft community. Even though he hasn't released a new video after 6 years, you should still go check out his redstone videos. They were mental.
